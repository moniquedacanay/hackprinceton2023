<h2>Motivation</h1>
American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson once claimed that, "the first wealth is health". A person's health is the key to the rest of their life. Their finances, family, and community are all affected by their health. So why has it become more and more difficult for those in poverty to access healthy food? With rising grocery prices, it has become a struggle to find affordable, healthy meals.

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
Our goal is to help people find the best value for their budget at the grocery store. We hope to accomplish this by searching for sales from local grocery stores for our users and leveraging the edamam api to find recipes and nutritional data for these sale items. Together we help users find affordable, healthy meals they can make at home.

<h2>Our Tech Stack</h2>
For our project, we employed the Next.JS framework for React.

<h2>The Future</h2>
In the future, we want to use an API to search for deals closest to the user to ensure that all recipes and deals would be relevant for the user. We also want to implement a user registration system to allow users to save recipes and add dietary restriction filters. Finally, we also want to add a deal rating system to give the user a numerical value for the quality of the deal they are receiving. This ensures that we are maximizing our users' money.
