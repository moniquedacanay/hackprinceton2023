<h1>Sustain-a-bite</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h1>
American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson once claimed that, "the first wealth is health". A person's health is the key to the rest of their life. Their finances, family, and community are all affected by their health. So why has it become more and more difficult for those in poverty to access healthy food? With rising grocery prices, it has become a struggle to find affordable, healthy meals.

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
Our goal is to help people find the best value for their budget at the grocery store. We accomplish this by searching local grocery store sales for users and leveraging the edamam api to find recipes and nutritional data for these sale items. Together we help users find affordable, healthy meals they can make at home.

<h2>Our Tech Stack</h2>
For our project, we employed the Next.JS framework for React.

<h2>The Future</h2>
Flyer API, user accounts to save recipe's, deal rating system to determine how much value the user is getting
